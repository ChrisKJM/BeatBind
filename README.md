Are you tired of constantly switching back and forth between your game and Spotify just to adjust the volume? With this app, you can finally control Spotify and adjust it's volume separately, all without the hassle of alt+tabbing. Say goodbye to interruptions and hello to effortless audio management!

This background Python Windows application utilizes the [global_hotkeys](https://github.com/btsdev/global_hotkeys) module to listen for basic hotkeys, allowing users to easily control Spotify without the window focused. The app leverages the power of [Spotify's Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) through the use of [Spotipy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy), providing seamless integration between the app and the music streaming platform.

### Where Is My Information Saved?
1. Press `Win+R` to bring up the "Run" menu, or type in "Run" within your Windows search bar.
1. Enter the following in the "Open" input field:
    ```
    %appdata%
    ```
1. Your information is stored locally within the `.../AppData/Roaming/.beatbind` folder. It stores your configuration settings and the token information required to interact with Spotify's Web API.
### What Information Is Saved?
There are two files stored within the `.../AppData/Roaming/.beatbind` folder:
- `config.json`, which contains your Client ID, Secret, Device ID, and your hotkey combinations.
- `.cache`, which contains your token information to communicate with the Spotify app.
### How Do I Update The App?
You can just replace your existing file(s) with the updated version. The config files are still saved within the `.../AppData/Roaming/.beatbind` folder, so your settings won't be lost.

Note: If your app keeps crashing after an update, you'll have to delete the `.../AppData/Roaming/.beatbind` folder and reinput your settings.
### How Do I Disable Certain Hotkeys?
1. Uncheck all of the `Modifiers` checkboxes.
2. In the `Key` field, press "Backspace" or "Delete" on your keyboard to clear the field.

### Why Isn't The App Starting on Startup?
This happens if the location of the app file was changed. The registry key used to start the app on Windows startup needs to be updated to the new `.exe` path. Starting the app again will update the path in the registry key and should resolve the issue.
### Why Is The App Not Starting?
Windows could be flagging it as a virus. Downloading the `.zip` folder instead or adding the `.exe` file to allowed files under Windows Security could fix your issue.

If that still doesnâ€™t work, check to see if you have the following folder, and then delete it: `.../AppData/Roaming/.beatbind`.
### My Hotkeys Stop Registering After Waking From Sleep.
There are rare cases where hotkeys stop registering on system wake up from sleep, and pressing `Start & Close` button again fixes the listener. For a more permanent fix, try disabling Windows Fast Startup. If the bug keeps occurring after disabling Fast Startup, please create an Issue ticket.
